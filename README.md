# Search Algorithms Visualization GUI
Welcome to the Search Algorithms Visualization GUI repository! This project offers a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to visualize a variety of searching algorithms, spanning uninformed, informed, and adversarial search techniques.

## Features
Wide Range of Algorithms: The GUI includes implementations of various searching algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* Search, and Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm.

Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the GUI to visualize the workings of different algorithms. They can adjust parameters such as the input graph and heuristic functions, providing a customizable learning experience.

## Implemented Algorithms
**Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traverses a graph by going as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

**A* Search:** A heuristic-based search algorithm that uses both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to reach the goal.

**Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm:** An adversarial search algorithm used for optimizing the minimax algorithm in game-playing scenarios.

**Best First Search:** A heuristic-based search algorithm that explores nodes with the lowest heuristic value, typically used in problems where the path cost is not known or irrelevant.

**Bidirectional Search:** Simultaneously explores the search space from both the start and goal nodes, aiming to find a path where the two searches meet in the middle.

**Depth Limited Search:** A variant of depth-first search that limits the depth of exploration, preventing infinite loops in infinite graphs or trees.

**Iterative Deepening Search:** An algorithm that combines depth-first search's depth-first exploration with breadth-first search's completeness, gradually increasing the depth limit until the goal is found.

**Uniform Cost Search:** Explores nodes with the lowest total cost from the start node, considering the cost of reaching each node from the start.

**Simulated Annealing:** A probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by annealing in metallurgy, used to find the global minimum of a function by simulating the annealing process to escape local minima.
